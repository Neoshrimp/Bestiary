# Bestiary
Shift+Right click a monster while in combat to view its AI patterns and abilities. An overlay is provided for all vanilla monsters - across all ascension levels.

## Controller Support

Target a monster using the D-Pad, and then press the "view draw pile" button (left trigger by default). To close the overlay, press the cancel button (B by default).

## Config

You can disable the *Shift* key modifier requirement in the Main Menu -> Mods -> Bestiary -> Config menu. This feature is enabled by default since it can be quite annoying to open up the menu if you right click while holding a card (e.g. canceling a card play after picking it up).

## Credits

This mod was originally written by ojb/casey-c (https://github.com/casey-c/bestiary). As the mod no longer seemed to be maintained or updated, and some small fixes were missing from the Steam version, I cloned it. All credit goes to the original author.
